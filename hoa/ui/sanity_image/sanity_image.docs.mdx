## SanityImage

Renders a responsive image from Sanity CMS. The image will have the `width` and `height`
attributes set such that the aspect ratio is maintained while the page loads [to avoid layout
shift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/images/aspect_ratio_mapping).
Furthermore, the image will have a placeholder background color set.

### Example

```js live
<FullWidthSanityImage
  image={{
    _id: "image-25f8378b9852da303afa2fd2c16b4a9f83aa9521-600x550-jpg",
    metadata: {
      dimensions: {
        _type: "sanity.imageDimensions",
        aspectRatio: 1.0909090909090908,
        height: 550,
        width: 600,
      },
      palette: {
        dominant: {
          _type: "sanity.imagePaletteSwatch",
          background: "#7c7d80",
          foreground: "#fff",
          population: 7.01,
          title: "#fff",
        },
      },
    },
    url: "https://cdn.sanity.io/images/xriwku0s/production/25f8378b9852da303afa2fd2c16b4a9f83aa9521-600x550.jpg",
  }}
/>
```
