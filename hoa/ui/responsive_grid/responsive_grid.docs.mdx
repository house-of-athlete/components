import { ResponsiveGrid } from "./responsive_grid"

A responsive grid. This component creates a `<div>` with the CSS variable named `--grid-columns`
set to the number of columns. The caller is responsible for CSS to create the grid.

`SizesContext` from the `@hoa/hoa.ui.use_full_width_sizes` package will be set such that images rendered
within the grid will be optimized.
